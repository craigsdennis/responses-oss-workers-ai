# Session 03: Interactive Word Game & UI Color Fixes

## What You Asked For

### First Request:
> Okay so for the next example I want to play one word at a time. I think it would be cool to show sentence as it goes, and then add the input field so the user can enter the next word. While the API is fetching make it clear that it is waiting for the text. The worker/index.ts has the new API /api/examples/create/stored. I'd like to show previous_response_id clearly in the example box, collapse the JSON too please.

### Follow-up Requests:
> The color of the word that is being added is white in the input box for some reason.
> The other input boxes are also white text in them. Can we fix the collapsey things too, they are black, and probably shouldn't be
> The "Full API Response" drop down background is black, can we make that look better?
> Buttons also have a black background. And the dropdowns are still black
> Ha now the inputs text color is white, we need to be able to see it. But the dropdown looks better.

## What I Implemented

### 1. **WordGameExample Component**
- **Interactive word-by-word storytelling** using `/api/examples/create/stored` endpoint
- **Visual sentence building** with alternating color-coded words:
  - Blue badges for user words
  - Purple badges for AI words
- **Previous Response ID display** - clearly shown in indigo information box
- **Reset functionality** - allows starting new games

#### Key Features:
- **Real-time story display** showing the sentence as it builds
- **Loading states** with "AI is thinking..." indicator and spinner
- **Single word input field** with contextual labels
- **Collapsed JSON by default** - API response hidden until clicked
- **Purple/indigo theme** with chat bubble icon

### 2. **Comprehensive UI Color Fixes**
Addressed multiple color visibility issues throughout the app:

#### Input Field Fixes:
- **Added text color classes** to all input/textarea elements: `text-gray-900 placeholder-gray-500`
- **Fixed global CSS overrides** that were causing white text
- **Proper contrast** for all form elements

#### JSON Display Improvements:
- **Enhanced dropdown styling** with light gray containers (`bg-gray-50`)
- **Professional code display** with proper dark containers (`bg-gray-800`)
- **Transparent JSON backgrounds** for better integration
- **Added padding and border-radius** for polished appearance

#### Button Background Fixes:
- **Global CSS override** for button transparency
- **Explicit `bg-transparent`** classes for dropdown toggles
- **Maintained gradient buttons** for primary actions

### 3. **Technical Implementation Details**

#### Word Game Logic:
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/examples/create/stored', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ 
    word: currentWord.trim(), 
    previous_response_id: previousResponseId 
  }),
})

setSentence(prev => [...prev, currentWord.trim(), data.word])
setPreviousResponseId(data.previous_response_id)
```

#### UI State Management:
- **Sentence array** tracking user and AI words
- **Loading states** during API calls
- **Response ID persistence** for conversation continuity
- **JSON visibility toggle** with collapsed default state

#### CSS Color Management:
```css
/* Separate button and input styling */
button {
  background-color: transparent;
  color: inherit;
}

input, textarea {
  background-color: white;
  color: #111827; /* gray-900 */
}
```

## Key Files Modified

- `src/App.tsx` - Added WordGameExample component
- `src/App.css` - Fixed global color overrides
- Layout updated to accommodate three examples

## Result

A complete interactive word game that demonstrates:
- **OpenAI Response API chaining** with `previous_response_id`
- **Real-time collaborative storytelling** between user and AI
- **Professional UI/UX** with proper color contrast throughout
- **Consistent visual design** across all three examples
- **Educational value** showing API context management

The app now features three distinct examples showcasing different aspects of the OpenAI Response API, all with polished, accessible interfaces.
