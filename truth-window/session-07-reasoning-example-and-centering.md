# Session 07: Reasoning Example and Layout Centering

## User Requests
1. Fix centering issue - content appearing left-aligned instead of centered in the browser
2. Add new ReasoningExample component for `/api/examples/create/reasoning` endpoint
3. Support topic input and effort level selection ("low", "medium", "high")
4. Display response with markdown-to-HTML conversion
5. Include collapsible JSON viewer like other examples
6. Give ReasoningExample its own full-width row instead of sharing with another demo

## Implementation Details

### Layout Centering Fix
- **Issue**: Content was pinned to the left side of the page instead of being centered
- **Root Cause**: CSS `text-align: left` was causing layout issues, but also flexbox centering was needed
- **Solution**: 
  - Temporarily changed `text-align: center` but reverted when user complained about text alignment
  - Added flexbox centering with `items-center` to main container
  - Used `w-full max-w-7xl` structure for proper full-width centering
  - Maintained `max-w-7xl mx-auto` for content area centering

### ReasoningExample Component
- **Package Addition**: Installed `markdown-to-jsx` for markdown rendering
- **Component Features**:
  - Topic input field (text input)
  - Effort level selector (dropdown with low/medium/high options)
  - API integration to `/api/examples/create/reasoning` endpoint
  - Markdown-to-HTML conversion using `markdown-to-jsx`
  - Collapsible JSON response viewer (consistent with other examples)
  - Violet/rose gradient theme with lightbulb icon
  - Loading states and form validation
  - Proper error handling

### Layout Structure Changes
- **Initial**: ReasoningExample placed in 2-column grid with FunctionCallingExample
- **Final**: ReasoningExample given its own full-width row for better content display
- **Result**: Better layout flow with more space for lesson plan content

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
```json
"markdown-to-jsx": "^7.7.12"
```

### Component Structure
- Form with topic input and effort level dropdown
- API call to new reasoning endpoint
- Markdown rendering with prose styling
- Collapsible JSON viewer with syntax highlighting
- Consistent loading states and error handling

### Layout Organization
```
Grid Row 1: BasicExample | StreamingExample
Grid Row 2: WordGameExample | CodeInterpreterExample  
Full Width: ReasoningExample
Full Width: FunctionCallingExample
Full Width: RelationshipViewer
```

## Files Modified
- `/src/App.tsx` - Added ReasoningExample component and updated layout
- `/src/App.css` - Temporarily modified text-align (reverted)
- `/package.json` - Added markdown-to-jsx dependency

## Outcome
- ✅ Content properly centered in browser while maintaining left-aligned text
- ✅ New ReasoningExample component fully functional
- ✅ Markdown rendering working properly
- ✅ Component has its own full-width layout for better UX
- ✅ Consistent with existing component patterns and styling
