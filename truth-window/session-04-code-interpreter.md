# Session 04: Code Interpreter Example & Button Text Fix

## What You Asked For

### First Request:
> Awesome! I've added a new "Code Interpreter" example it's at /api/examples/create/code-interpeter . The user tells a story and it tells you how much you would've been paid in minimum wage. The idea is it extracts text from a story. So let the user enter a story and then use the outputText to display back to them.

### Follow-up Request:
> Awesome can you also fix the button text, it's too grey. Maybe make that whiteish? Your call

## What I Implemented

### 1. **CodeInterpreterExample Component**
- **Teal/cyan gradient theme** with calculator icon for visual distinction
- **Story-based input** for users to describe work time activities
- **Minimum wage calculation** using OpenAI's code interpreter capabilities
- **API integration** with `/api/examples/create/code-interpreter` endpoint

#### Key Features:
- **Large textarea input** for story entry with contextual placeholder
- **Loading states** with "Calculating..." spinner during processing
- **Wage analysis display** showing AI's time extraction and wage calculations
- **Collapsible JSON viewer** for full API response inspection
- **Professional styling** consistent with other examples

### 2. **Enhanced Layout Structure**
- **Updated grid layout** to 2x2 arrangement for four examples
- **Balanced visual presentation** with examples properly distributed
- **Responsive design** maintained across all screen sizes

### 3. **Button Text Visibility Fix**
- **Identified color inheritance issue** causing grey text on gradient buttons
- **Added targeted CSS rule** for gradient buttons: `button.bg-gradient-to-r { color: white !important; }`
- **Fixed all gradient buttons** across all four examples

## Technical Implementation Details

### Code Interpreter Integration:
```typescript
const res = await fetch('/api/examples/create/code-interpreter', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ story }),
})
```

### Backend Endpoint Features:
- **Code interpreter tool** with auto container type
- **Required tool choice** ensuring Python execution
- **Minimum wage calculation** at $15/hour
- **Time extraction** from freeform text stories
- **Output filtering** with `include: ["code_interpreter_call.outputs"]`

### CSS Color Management:
```css
button.bg-gradient-to-r {
  color: white !important;
}
```

## Key Files Modified

- `src/App.tsx` - Added CodeInterpreterExample component and updated layout
- `src/App.css` - Fixed button text color visibility
- Layout now features 2x2 grid with four distinct examples

## Result

A comprehensive educational app showcasing four different OpenAI Response API patterns:

1. **BasicExample** - Standard text generation with JSON viewer
2. **StreamingExample** - Real-time token streaming 
3. **WordGameExample** - Conversation continuity with stored responses
4. **CodeInterpreterExample** - Code execution for data analysis and calculations

### New Capabilities Demonstrated:
- **Tool integration** with code interpreter
- **Data extraction** from unstructured text
- **Mathematical calculations** using Python
- **Structured output** with wage analysis
- **Professional UI/UX** with proper contrast and accessibility

The app now provides a complete educational experience covering the full spectrum of OpenAI Response API functionality, from basic text generation to advanced code interpretation and analysis.
